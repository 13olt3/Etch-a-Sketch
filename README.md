# Etch-a-Sketch

create a 16 x 16 square grid of divs using JS
use a loop
i and j
for vertical and horizontal

change the name 16 times
create element 16 times once per name change
append child


in each div row create a child container

create event listener when mouse leaves box, change box color

creating size of the grid
default grid size is (200px * 200px)
16 squares by 16 square is default
so square width and height is math floor 200/16 px;

finished adding grid adding button functionality. need to remove grid before adding a new one
change width and height of tiles to equal 200 / no of tiles px
